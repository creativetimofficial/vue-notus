### Bug fixing

- Rename `master` branch to `main`
- To make a lot of our changes, we've followed the instructions from here (minus the `colors` and `font-sizes`): https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrading-to-v2
  - For the colors, the only change that we made, is the fact that we've added all Tailwind CSS colors to our `tailwind.config.js` files, and inside our product, all `{type}-gray-{number}` classes were renamed to `{type}-blueGray-{number}`
  - After that, we've changed `{type}-blueGray-{number}` to `{type}-blueGray-{lower-number}`, i.e. (`100` became `50`, `200` became `100`, ..., `900` became `800`)
    - You can achieve this, by search in your whole project for `blueGray-100` and replace it with `blueGray-50`
    - Then, you search in your whole project for `blueGray-200` and replace it with `blueGray-100`
    - Then, you search in your whole project for `blueGray-300` and replace it with `blueGray-200`
    - Then, you search in your whole project for `blueGray-400` and replace it with `blueGray-300`
    - Then, you search in your whole project for `blueGray-500` and replace it with `blueGray-400`
    - Then, you search in your whole project for `blueGray-600` and replace it with `blueGray-500`
    - Then, you search in your whole project for `blueGray-700` and replace it with `blueGray-600`
    - Then, you search in your whole project for `blueGray-800` and replace it with `blueGray-700`
    - Then, you search in your whole project for `blueGray-900` and replace it with `blueGray-800`
  - For the colors, the only change that we made, is the fact that we've added all Tailwind CSS colors to our `tailwind.config.js` files, and inside our product, all `{type}-blue-{number}` classes were renamed to `{type}-lightBlue-{number}`
  - For the colors, the only change that we made, is the fact that we've added all Tailwind CSS colors to our `tailwind.config.js` files, and inside our product, all `{type}-green-{number}` classes were renamed to `{type}-emerald-{number}`
- `lg:bg-transparent` is not working anymore, so we've changed it with `lg:bg-opacity-0`

### Warning

_On a clean install there may be some warnings from request, chokidar, fsevents - they come from node_modules, and they do not affect the product at all._
_The following warning will show when doing a clean install `npm WARN cache-loader@4.1.0 requires a peer of webpack@^4.0.0 but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.`, however it does not affect in any way the product._
